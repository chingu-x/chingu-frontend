          <React.Fragment>
            A Voyage is an ambitious community with shared goals and an opportunity to gain experience 
            learning and building with a team. Those that are accepted are organized into remote teams, 
            given prompts and various tools to aid them accelerate their learning.

      {
        question: 'What are the technical qualifications?',
        answer: `You need to have built something. Your very first project should not be a team project.

      },
      {
        question: 'What are the non-technical qualifications?',
        answer: `Soft skills are the greatest skill we can learn, and are paramount to any team’s success. 
                We don’t expect you to be a master, but we do expect you to have read the prep material on soft skills. `
      },
      {

            Chingu members come from the 15 - 150 range. New learners who have built a project or two → experienced
            professional developers learning new skills (new frameworks, leadership, mentorship)

            In a typical Voyage, you can expect to have the opportunity to
            earn various Hard and Soft skills.

        question: 'Why can we use any tech-stack?',
        answer: (
          <React.Fragment>
            Yes, Chingu is tech-stack agnostic and the team decides together what tech-stack to use.
                <br />
            <br />
            A big portion of our team-formation algorithm is connecting people who have similar experience
            levels and tech-stack preferences.
                 <br />
            <br />
            Most people who join Chingu thus far are into Web-Development, and the most common stack is MERN
            (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) for the more experienced and HTML/CSS/Basic Javascript for the newer learners.

        question: `What's a typical day like in the Voyage?`,
        answer: `This really depends on the team and particular Voyage, but building something or learning what 
                is needed to build something likely on an average day. All with the support of a community doing the same thing. `
      },
      {
        question: `Can I really become a developer by doing Voyages?`,
        answer: `Yes, many people get a job both during and after each Voyage. Though see below for the 
                  next question related to this. `
      },
      {
        question: `Will I be guaranteed a job after completing a project?`,
        answer: (
          <React.Fragment>
            People and constantly getting jobs in the Chingu ecosystem, but completing one Voyage does not
            guarantee you will get a job. We launch teams at all levels - from newer learners building landing
            pages to experienced experts building full stack applications.
            <br />
            <br />
            That being said, by doing Voyages you gain in-demand hard skills and learn how to work in a
            modern team, the two core aspects all employees look for.

                  you facilitate (e.g., web development, digital marketing). Is Chingu still for me? `,
        answer: `No, we encourage absolute beginners to build a few projects before applying to Chingu. 
                Your very first project should not be a team project. `
      },
      {
        question: `What makes you different from other coding bootcamps?`,
        answer: `Chingu isn’t a coding bootcamp - we’re a collaboration capital for ambitious learners. `

          <React.Fragment>
            If you’re a first time member, there’s no way to secure a spot, though we try to give as many new people an opportunity.
            <br />
            <br />
            Once you are accepted, you can secure your spot by maintaining a high reputation score.

        question: `Besides the hours spent communicating with my team, how much time do I need to dedicate 
                  to a Voyage outside of communication?`,
        answer: (
          <React.Fragment>
            This is dependent on your skill level, the team dynamics, and how outside of your comfort zone the project is.
            <br />
            <br />
            For example, if you’re using a tech-stack you’re familiar with, you would need to spend much less time
            than if you’re learning a new framework to complete your tasks.

      },

        question: `What will happen after I complete an application?`,
        answer: (
          <React.Fragment>
            You will receive a notification that your application has been received.
            <br />
            <br />

        question: `When should I apply to get into a particular Voyage cohort?`,
        answer: `We typically run Voyages every few months, so you can apply at anytime. That being said, 
                to be safe we recommend applying 6-8 weeks early. `
      },
      {
        question: `What if I am accepted into Chingu and need to change my start date?`,

        question: `What is the policy on absence for special events, weddings, trips, etc?`,
        answer: (
          <React.Fragment>
            It all depends on the specific context. The Voyage is 8 weeks, so for most cases as long as you communicate
            and the team adapts as necessary it’s fine.
            <br />
            <br />
            Laziness or apathy are not appropriate excuses.
            <br />
            <br />
            Chingu is a meritocracy and your actions now will dictate your opportunities in the future on the platform.
            Your peers will be rating you out of 5 each week as a team-mate, and the average of those ratings will
            dictate whether you can join a Voyage in the future, as well as the type of team-mates you may have (ex.
            People who have a score of 2 likely have issues with unreliability, and it wouldn’t be fair to place them
            with someone who has proven to be reliable).

                suggestions to help you prepare for your Voyage.`
      },
      {
        question: `How are teams matched together?`,

                encourage inexperienced teams to follow these prompts, but ultimately it is the team who decides. `
      },
      {
        question: `Are all projects unique?`,
        answer: `No. About half the projects are unique projects and the other half are clones of popular startups like Airbnb or Spotify. 
                The goal at Chingu is to learn and build, so both are welcomed! `
      },

            <br />
            <br />
            You’re given a team Slack channel for communication, a project roadmap to follow, and if possible a Project Manager.

        question: `What platform do teams work on?`,
        answer: (
          <React.Fragment>
            A typical team will utilize a workflow that includes the following platforms:
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>Slack/ Discord/ Google Hangouts for team communication and meetings</li>

            In a typical Voyage we may launch 70-110 different teams. These teams will range from 
            people working on landing pages, to data science projects to full stack applications. 
            Projects will have different ambition levels and scope, and some won’t be able to finish 
            in the time frame. That is completely okay and we always have some teams that transfer 
            into the next Voyage to continue working on it.
