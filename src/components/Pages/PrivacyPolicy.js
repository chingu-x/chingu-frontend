        <h4>Security</h4>
        <p>
          We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit
          sensitive information via the website, your information is protected
          both online and offline.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wherever we collect information it is encrypted and transmitted to us
          in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the
          address bar and looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of
          the Web page.

          While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted
          online, we also protect your information offline. Only staff members who
          need the information to perform a specific job (for example, processing
          support tickets) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
        </p>
